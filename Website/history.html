      <td width="434" colspan="2" class="body"><p>Formed in 1995, Slipknot was founded by bassist Paul Gray and percussionist Shawn Crahan. The original lineup consisted of Joey Jordison on the drums, Josh Brainard and Donnie Steele on guitars, as well as Anders Colsefni as the  lead vocalist. Over the years, Brainard was dropped from the band and was replaced by Mick Thompson and Craig Jones who later switched from guitar to samples. The 7-man band recorded their first demo album &quot;<em>Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.</em>&quot; in 1996. The following year, Anders Colsefni was replaced by Corey Taylor, a vocalist from another local band called <em>Stone Sour</em>. DJ Sid Wilson was also invited into the band in 1998 with another new percussonist Chris Fehn. The next year, Donnie Steele was dropped and replaced with Jim Root in 1999. </p>
        <p>On June 29, 1999, Slipknot released their first studio self-titled album under Roadrunner Records. The album quickly rose to popularity and became Roadrunner Records' first certified double platinum record in the US. After the success of their first studio album, Slipknot released four more albums which received Grammy nominations and a win for Best Metal Performance in 2006 for their song, &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_I_Forget_(song)" target="_blank">Before I Forget</a>&quot;. Their fourth studio album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.        </p>
        <p>In May of 2010, bassist and founding member Paul Gray was found dead from an accidental overdose. The death of Gray hit hard for the rest of the band members, which put the future of the band in jeopardy. However, the band managed to bounce back and continued to release records. With Paul Gray gone, Slipknot continued performing with the remaining members of the band.</p>
        <p>By 2013, drummer Joey Jordison split from the band. Slipknot recurited two new members for their fifth studio album, bassist Alessandro Venturella and Jay Weinberg on the drums. Shortly after, percussionist Chris Fehn was dropped from the band and was replaced by an unknown new member dubbed &quot;Tortilla Man&quot;.</p>
        <p>Today,  Slipknot are one of the most popular metal bands since the 21st century having sold more than 30 million records from all the world. The band are currently touring and promoting their sixth studio album &quot;<em>We Are Not Your Kind&quot; </em>as well as hosting their annual music festival <em>Knotfest</em>. </p>
