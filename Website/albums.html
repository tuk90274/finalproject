		  <p>Slipknot released a total of six studio albums as of this time. The first of their self-titled studio album <em>Slipknot</em> received positive ratings and attracted a lot of new followers to the band. Nominated for Best Metal Performance for their single &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_and_Bleed" target="_blank">Wait and Bleed</a>&quot;, the album featured a variety of musical styles in metal subgenres. The band itself is highly regarded as nu metal. Their first studio album quickly picked up on influences from death metal, thrash, speed metal, alternative metal, industrial metal, and even rap metal. </p>
		  <p>The second studio album <em>Iowa</em> consisted some of Slipknot's most brutal pieces of work. All band members involved in recording the album described the experienced &quot;extreme&quot;. There was a lot of aggression put into producing the album, influenced by the members' alcohol abuse, drug problems, and hate all around. Multiple singles off the album were again nominated for Grammys and received another positive ratings.</p>
		  <p><em>Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)</em> won Slipknot's first Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance off the track &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_I_Forget_(song)" target="_blank">Before I Forget</a>&quot;. It was featured on the UK magazine<em> Kerrang!</em>'s &quot;The 50 Best Albums of the 21st Century&quot; as well as on <em>Rock Hard</em>'s &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. A few years later, Slipknot released <em>All Hope Is Gone</em> which was the last album to feature  the now-deceased bassist Paul Gray and drummer Joey Jordison before his split. The album was just as dark as their previous albums lyrically and it managed to appeal to the fans as always.</p>
		  <p><em>.5: The Gray Chapter</em> was the first Slipknot album to feature new members, Alessandro Venturella and Jay Weinberg. It was also the band's first album in six years. The album debuted on top of the international weekly charts and continued to receive Grammy nominations for multiple singles. A few years later, Slipknot recorded and release their sixth studio album <em>We Are Not Your Kind</em> without percussionist Chris Fehn. Their latest album was quickly regarded one of Slipknot's greatest releases as it debuted at number 1 on Billboard 200 and other charts. It took almost two years of writing  and received another round of positive critical receptions. </p>
